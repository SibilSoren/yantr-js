# Introduction 🪛

Welcome to **Yantr-js**, a "Shadcn for Backend" CLI designed to accelerate your Express.js development without sacrificing ownership.

## The Philosophy: Ownership over Abstraction

Most backend scaffolders hide their logic behind complex dependencies or high-level abstractions. When you need to customize a core behavior (like how JWTs are handled), you find yourself fighting the framework.

**Yantr-js takes a different approach.**

Instead of being a dependency, Yantr-js is a **code orchestrator**. It injects high-quality, production-ready TypeScript code directly into your project.

### Key Principles

- **Ownership**: The code is yours. Once it's in your `lib/yantr` folder, you own it. Change it, delete it, or extend it.
- **Zero Bloat**: Only the code you need is added. No massive "base" dependencies that you never use.
- **Type Safety**: Built from the ground up with TypeScript and Zod for robust, self-documenting code.
- **Production-Ready**: Patterns we've battle-tested in real production environments (Pino logging, Prisma singletons, Helmet security).

## How it Works

1. **`yantr init`**: Prepares your project with a configuration file and base utilities (like global error handling).
2. **`yantr add`**: Fetches specific components (Auth, DB, etc.) from our registry and places them in your project.
3. **`yantr generate`**: Scaffolds repetitive patterns like Routes, Controllers, and Services.

## Why "Yantr"?

"Yantr" (यन्त्र) is the Sanskrit word for **Instrument** or **Machine**. We believe that while AI and automation can build the machine, the developer should always be the one holding the instruments.
