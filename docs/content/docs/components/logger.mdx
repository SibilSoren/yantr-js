# Logging 🪵

The `logger` component provides high-performance, structured logging using **Pino**. It is pre-configured for human-readable output in development and efficient JSON output in production.

## Installation

```bash
yantr add logger
```

## Included Files

- `lib/yantr/logger/logger.ts`: The core Pino logger instance.
- `lib/yantr/logger/http-logger.ts`: Middleware for HTTP request logging.

## Usage

### Middleware Logging

Add the `httpLogger` to your global Express middleware:

```typescript
import { httpLogger } from './lib/yantr/logger/http-logger';

app.use(httpLogger);
```

This will log every incoming request with its status code, method, and response time.

### Custom Logging

Import the `logger` anywhere in your application:

```typescript
import { logger } from './lib/yantr/logger/logger';

logger.info({ userId: '123' }, 'User action completed');
logger.error(error, 'An unexpected error occurred');
```

## Environments

- **Development**: Pretty-printed with colors (requires `pino-pretty`).
- **Production**: Optimized JSON format, ideal for log aggregation services (ELK, Datadog, etc.).
